- The first line contains the number of queries, Q.
- Each of the next Q lines contains a single query of any one of the 3 above mentioned types.



 **1.** It is guaranteed that the element to be deleted will be there in the heap.  
 **2.** At any instant, only distinct elements will be in the heap.
