**Challenge**: Given two strings, A and B. Find if there is a substring that appears in both A and B.

**Specifications:** Several test cases will be given to you in a single file. The first line of the input will contain a single integer T, the number of test cases.

Then there will be T descriptions of the test cases. Each description contains two lines. The first line contains the string A and the second line contains the string B.

For each test case, display YES (in a newline), if there is a common substring. Otherwise, display NO.
